I will not remove the fail safe of a limit of how many times the program with go
(I dont want to be responsible for when u set the delay to .0001 and ur computer is unusable for a few hours)

May add a option to allow multiple clicks at one cord

HOW TO USE:

Click the GET X Y, either move the button to where you want the x and y cord
or click the delayed button and hover over where you need x and y

copy the x and y into the designated box, then repeat supports up to 20 cord selections.
this program does a single click at each one, can be set up as a auto clicker at 1 cord by getting the x and y
then changing the delay to whatevery you want then adding a number to how many times to repeat.

there are no hotkeys to stop the program, so this is your warning

Have fun!
